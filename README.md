# NS-wrangle
- The play I was assigned or selected is Troilus and Cressida.
- My speaker 1 is Alexander.
- My speaker 2 is Agamemnon.
- The question I was asked in the class is "which speaker name is repeated more in the play?".
- the commands I used to complete this challenge are 
##  curl "http://shakespeare.mit.edu/troilus_cressida/full.html" -O "ns.txt"
## grep -i ‘Alexander’ or 'Agamemnon' ns.txt -c
- The speaker whose name repeated the most is Agamemnon.
